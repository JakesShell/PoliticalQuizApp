# PoliticalQuizApp
This repository contains a Java application designed to help users determine their political affiliation through a quiz. The PoliticalQuizApp uses a series of questions and weighted answers from different political parties to analyze user responses and provide insights into their political leanings.

Features:

Multiple Political Parties: The app includes predefined answers for Democratic, Republican, Independent, and Progressive parties.
Weighted Scoring System: Each answer carries a weight that reflects its significance, allowing for a nuanced analysis of user responses.
User Interaction: Users are prompted to answer a series of questions, with their selections impacting the final score.
Data Persistence: User answers are saved to and loaded from a file, ensuring that progress can be resumed later.

How It Works:

Initialization: The application initializes party-specific answers and weights.
User Input: Users answer 20 questions, selecting options from A to D.
Results Calculation: Scores are calculated based on user selections, determining the most likely political affiliation.
Data Management: User responses are saved to a file for future sessions.
This project serves as an engaging tool for individuals looking to explore their political preferences while demonstrating key programming concepts such as data structures, file handling, and user interaction in Java.
